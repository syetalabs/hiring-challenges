# Mobile Engineer Challange

## Greetings :sparkles:

At Syeta Labs we are keen to see your passion and coding style.
So let's get started.

## Your Task :rocket:

Your task is to implement a simple user specific task list mobile app.

### Basic Requirements :memo: - Scout

-  Create an interface where users can enter their username and password.

-   Once clicked on the login button execute below API and handle the success and failure
    responses.
```
url - https://dummyjson.com/auth/login
method - post
body - {username: 'kminchelle', password: '0lelplR',}
```
-   When successful login, redirect to home view and display the user's FirstName in the app bar.
### Additional Tasks :white_check_mark: - Pioneer

-   List all the users return from below api, display name and email in a list

```
url - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
method - get
```
-   Show a detailed view when clicking on each user item.
### Challenging Tasks :fire: - Legend


-   On a user detail view, you should be able to add tasks (task id, task description) for each
    user and save tasks in the local database.
-   On the same detail view, show tasks for each user at the second half of the screen. If
    tasks are not available should display a message.

## About the system :zap:

However this is not limited to the above scope, you can add any additional features :wink:.

But we don't expect it to be perfect or bulletproof. :gun:

> It should not take more than 2 days to complete the challenge :construction:

You can use any programming language to implement this.
We prefer **Android/Java/kotlin**, **Flutter**, **React Native** and **Swift**.

You can use any database you like. It can be SQL/NoSQL or whatever you see fit for the task.

Since you are architecting this software system, we will ask you questions about design decisions. :bulb:

## Guidelines :hammer:

- You should manage a GitHub repository to complete the task. Make it a private repository and add the mentioned Syeta member as a collaborator after the completion.

- The repository can use syeta-hiring-mobile-challenge as the name

- Write a good README about the architecture of your system.

- Send an email to hr@syetalabs.io after completion

**Happy Coding :tada:**
