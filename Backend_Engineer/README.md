# Backend Engineer Challange

## Greetings :sparkles:

At Syeta Labs we are keen to see your passion and coding style.
So let's get started.

## Your Task :rocket:

Your task is to implement a simple Event Management system with a REST API or GraphQL API.

### Requirements :memo: - Level Scout

- Admins should be able to submit an event to the platform with `title`, `description`, `banner image`, `time` and `venue`. There can be any additional properties as you wish.

- Users should be able to see `active events`, `past events`, `future events` and events in a date range.

### Additional Tasks :white_check_mark: - Level Pioneer

- Users should be able to vote for events as well.
Also, some users might want to sort events based on popularity too.

### Challenging Tasks :fire: - Level Legend

- Additionally, you can implement the system to stream new events notifications to users(You can use WebSockets).

## About the system :zap:

However this is not limited to the above scope, you can add any additional features :wink:.

But we don't expect it to be perfect or bulletproof. :gun:

> It should not take more than a week to complete the challenge :construction:

You can use any programming language to implement this.
We prefer **Javascript/Typescript**, **Golang**, **Elixir**, **Java** and **C#**.

You can use any database you like. It can be SQL/NoSQL or whatever you see fit for the task.

Since you are architecting this software system, we will ask you questions about design decisions. :bulb:

## Guidelines :hammer:

- You should manage a GitHub repository to complete the task. Make it a private repository and add user **kasvith** as a collaborator after the completion.

- The repository can use syeta-hiring-backend-challenge as the name

- Write a good README about how to test your system.

**Happy Coding :tada:**
